# Introduction
While a great deal of analysis of the relative performance of regional climate models (RCM) has been done to date, facilitated by coordinated activities such as PRUDENCE, NARCAP, and CORDEX, very little analysis of the relative performance characteristics of empirical-statistical downscaling (ESD) methods has been documented.  Recent work under the European VALUE program, involved an analysis of a range of downscaling methods, including ESD.  The work presented here falls under the COordinated Regional Downscaling EXperiment (CORDEX), and in particular the ESD component of that activity and represents the first ESD inter-comparison experiment under CORDEX.  It must be noted that due to the far higher degree of heterogeneity of ESD methods than is found across RCMs, this activity represents as much an effort to encourage collaboration and coordinate comparison across a diverse community as much as it is also a methods inter-comparison analysis.
